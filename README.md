## üîß Code Organization

### API Layer

The `api.ts` file contains all API-related code, including:
- API client configuration (using axios)
- Functions for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting comments
- Error handling for API requests
- Type-safe API responses

### Component Architecture

Components follow a clear separation of concerns:
- **App.tsx**: Manages state and orchestrates data flow
- **CommentCard**: Presentation component for individual comments
- **CommentDialog**: Form handling and validation for comment creation/editing

### State Management

The application uses React's built-in state management with:
- `useState` for local component state
- `useEffect` for side effects like API calls
- Props for passing data between components

### Styling Approach

The project uses Tailwind CSS with:
- Utility classes for most styling
- Component-specific styles
- Responsive design patterns
- Custom gradients for visual appeal
- Dark mode support

## üîç Key Features Implementation

### Comment Filtering

The application supports filtering comments by:
- Text search across name, email, and body
- Post ID filtering
- Email domain filtering
- Alphabetical sorting (A-Z and Z-A)

### Form Validation

The comment form includes validation for:
- Required fields
- Email format validation
- Instant feedback on validation errors

### Toast Notifications

User actions trigger toast notifications for:
- Successful operations (add, update)
- Error messages
- Confirmation messages (delete)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **API Errors**: If you see "Failed to load comments" errors, check your internet connection or try refreshing the page.
